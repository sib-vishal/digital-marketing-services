                                CSS or JavaScript contains the codes that include the information that determines if the website is mobile-friendly or not. The search crawlers need access to the scripts to rank the websites on SERPs. These scripts play an important role to ensure that the search engines fully render your website. Back a few years, some of these technologies were not supported by mobile devices so the developers considered blocking CSS, JavaScript, or images for user's convenience. Since the times have changed drastically, developers need not block these elements at present as they play a crucial role in helping search engines understand if your website is responsive and efficient or not. The web crawlers and Google bots look for these elements as to segregate websites as per audience needs.</p>

                                mobile optimization is responsible to update and maintain all the local searches on your website. The local info plays a dominant role in determining if the user finds your website when they search for the services near themselves. The audience often searches for a local business near them, the local information plays its part in such situations. If your business involves local or geographical based services or elements never ignore them to be optimized for mobile content for local searches. It includes the name of your company, address, contact details along with your city and state name in the website's metadata.</p>
