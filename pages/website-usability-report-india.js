                                 is every effort made to ensure that important information is on the home page and internal linking and copy writing complement each other. Can users find the information they are looking for quickly and is the copy writing informative and concise? The number of websites that have web pages that end in a dead end with no linking or navigation back. This is very poor web design.

                                 do forms work, do fields return proper error messages when wrong entries are made, is every effort made to ensure database integrity. Quite amazingly, many websites have errors in functionality and this is a result of poor testing and code that has not been debugged. The internet user should not be the one debugging your website and even on government, gateway banking and local library sites there are errors because of a failure to conduct usability testing.

                                 How good is the website code and what happens to the speed of page loading when multiple users access the website. Does your web design code meet the w3 standards for web design?

                                 can your website be found on search engines and is the website properly coded with the appropriate metatags, title tags, keywords and programmed to be search engine friendly.

                                 does your website compliment the image of your business. Are web friendly colours used? What does your website look like in different browsers, other than internet explorer and is it still functional in different browsers?

                                 is the website style consistent with the target audience and written for the internet and are words chosen that users would use to find your product or service. Does your website bore potential visitors? Is your website simply a reproduced brochure?

Are instructions clear and important information like contact details, delivery costs, terms and conditions, etc easily accessible and is copy writing effective in leading users to the right information or do users struggle to find important information on your website? Do all pdf files have a size and estimated download time? Are links to pdf reader, and other plug ins put in the appropriate areas and are instructions for downloading and using these applications clear.
